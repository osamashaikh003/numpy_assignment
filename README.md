# NumPy Basics Practice Assignment

This repository contains my solutions for a NumPy basics practice assignment, designed to reinforce fundamental concepts and operations using the NumPy library in Python.

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of various NumPy functionalities to perform array creation, manipulation, and basic numerical operations. The assignment focuses on practicing core NumPy concepts.

## Assignment Details

* "The assignment required creating and manipulating NumPy arrays to perform various mathematical operations."
* "We were tasked with practicing array slicing, indexing, reshaping, and broadcasting using NumPy."
* "The assignment focused on using NumPy to solve basic linear algebra and statistical problems."

## Tools and Libraries

* **Python:** Programming language used.
* **NumPy:** Numerical computing library.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive coding and documentation environment.

## Key Implementations

* **Array Creation:** Creating NumPy arrays using `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`, etc.
* **Array Indexing and Slicing:** Accessing and modifying array elements using various indexing and slicing techniques.
* **Array Reshaping and Transposing:** Changing the shape of arrays using `reshape()` and `transpose()`.
* **Array Operations:** Performing element-wise arithmetic operations, matrix multiplication, and other mathematical operations.
* **Array Broadcasting:** Understanding and applying broadcasting rules for array operations.
* **Array Aggregation:** Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) using NumPy functions.
* **Random Number Generation:** (If applicable) Generating random numbers and arrays using NumPy's random module.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
3.  Install the required libraries: `pip install numpy jupyter`
4.  Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook numpy_basics.ipynb` (or `pytest test_cases.py` if tests are included)
